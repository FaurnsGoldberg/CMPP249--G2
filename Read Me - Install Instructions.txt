In order to run the program, you must import the .sql file included in the sql folder, 'TravelExpertsUpdated.sql'.
You must delete or rename any existing databases with the name 'travelexperts' before the import will work.


Then, create an sql user with the name 'traveldbadmin', password 'tdba123' with full permissions for the travelexperts DB.
